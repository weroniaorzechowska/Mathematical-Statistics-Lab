# Statistical Methods & Hypothesis Testing üìä

## Overview üìå
This repository contains implementations and analyses of **key statistical methods**, focusing on **probability distributions, estimation techniques, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing**. The project provides hands-on applications of fundamental concepts in **mathematical statistics**, leveraging real-world datasets and simulations.

## Objectives üéØ
- Explore **probability distributions** and their properties
- Implement **point and interval estimation** methods
- Analyze **sampling variability** and statistical properties of estimators
- Construct and interpret **confidence intervals** for different parameters
- Perform **hypothesis testing** for means, variances, and proportions

## Topics Covered üìñ
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Probability Distributions & Simulation**
- Generating random samples from **normal, uniform, and Cauchy distributions**
- Visualizing **empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs)** vs. theoretical distributions
- Comparing the behavior of different estimators for various distributions

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Estimation Methods**
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** and its properties
- **Method of Moments Estimation (MME)** and empirical bias comparison
- Evaluating **mean squared error (MSE)** of different estimators

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Confidence Intervals & Variability**
- Constructing **confidence intervals** for:
  - Population **means** (normal and unknown variance cases)
  - Population **variances** using chi-square distributions
  - Population **proportions** from survey data
- Empirical validation of **coverage probability** of confidence intervals

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Hypothesis Testing**
- **Parametric tests**:
  - One-sample and two-sample **t-tests** for mean comparisons
  - **Chi-square tests** for variance assumptions
  - **Z-tests for proportions** in population surveys
- **Non-parametric tests**:
  - Wilcoxon test for median comparison
  - Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for distributional assumptions
- **Applied hypothesis testing**:
  - Quality control: **bottle pressure resistance tests**
  - Market analysis: **weight variation in coffee jars**
  - A/B testing: **memory enhancement training effectiveness**
  - Machine learning validation: **predicting exam performance**


## Key Insights üîé
‚úÖ **MLE vs. MME:** MLE generally has lower bias but higher variance compared to MME.  
‚úÖ **Confidence intervals vary with sample size:** Larger samples lead to narrower confidence intervals.  
‚úÖ **Hypothesis testing is sample-dependent:** Small samples may lead to Type I or Type II errors.  
‚úÖ **Probability distributions affect estimator performance:** Heavy-tailed distributions impact mean estimation significantly.
